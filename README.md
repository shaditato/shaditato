### Hi there 👋

This is where I put the source code for many of my projects. I love working with JavaScript/TypeScript and React primarily, but also Python and others. Currently learning about the cloud ⛅

Some of the projects you can find here:
- 📗 [**Produtime:**](https://github.com/shaditato/Produtime) A Firebase/React productivity & time-tracking web app.
- 💻 [**shaditato.com:**](https://github.com/shaditato/shaditato.com) My personal website, a simple React page. Mostly used for hosting projects!
- ✂️ [**Clipping Tool:**](https://github.com/shaditato/clipping-tool) An Electron desktop app for generating screen recordings.

Thanks for visiting 🐸
